# Kubernetes Examples

A reference repository of YAML with canonical and as-simple-as-possible demonstrations of kubernetes functionality and features.

## Why?

At Container Solutions we find we regularly need chunks of YAML to  demonstrate something specific, such as:

- A simple deployment

- A simple pod

- A pod with a volume

This might be to do a basic test of an environment, find an example to tinker with, or send to someone to get them going.


## Sections

`broken-*` - yamls that exemplify broken kubernetes yaml states

## Principles

The examples seek to be:

- As simple as possible to illustrate the functionality

- Self-contained (ie limited to one .yaml file)

- Non-conflicting (eg resource names are unique)

- Clear (eg resource names are verbose and unambiguous)
