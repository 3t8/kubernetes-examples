# Kubernetes Examples

A reference repository of YAML with canonical and as-simple-as-possible demonstrations of kubernetes functionality and features.

## Why?

I often find myself needing a chunk of yaml to hand to do demonstrate something specific, such as:

- A simple deployment

- A simple pod

- A pod with a volume

This might be to do a basic test of an env, find an example to tinker with, or send to someone to get them going.
